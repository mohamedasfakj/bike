    <p>Before we dive into paragraph structure, let’s start with paragraph meaning.
         A paragraph is an individual segment of writing that discusses a central idea, typically with more than one sentence. It even has its own paragraph symbol in copyediting, called the pilcrow (¶),
         not to be confused with the section symbol called the silcrow that’s common in legal code. </p>
